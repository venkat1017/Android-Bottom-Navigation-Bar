# Android-Bottom-Navigation-Bar
Its been a while since Google introduced Material Design, but recently with Design Support Library v25 they released a new widget to make an Android Bottom Navigation Bar, as described in the official material design specs. This new navigation component is called the BottomNavigationView and as mentioned, its packaged under the design support library, having full backward support. Although if you browse the internet, you may find many examples, showing how to implement an Android bottom navigation bar. But this new Android BottomNavigationView widget makes it very easy for the developers to build and deploy apps with bottom navigation, as its an official component.
